# Logo-Generator

## Description
This is a command-line application which generates a brand new logo (svg file) for you based on four inputs of your choosing. The inputs selected from a prompt will be the shape of the three letters you want to include in the logo, the shape of logo, and the color of the text and shape itself.

This allows you to easily and quickly generate a logo based on custom parameters.
